Group 2 solution for Automating Email Sending includes these steps:
1. Import libraries that we use in the project:
    a. datetime - to add date and time to log files
    b. os.path - to check whether the attachment file exists or not
    c. smtplib - to connect to main server and send emails
    d. time -to "sleep", pause of execution for a specified time
    e. logging - to create log files and also log info to the console
    f. email - library to make sent emails fancy and contains attachments
    g. schedule - to schedule the execution of the code to the specified time
    h. configparser - to read config.ini file with the configuration settings (scheduled time, sender email, and its password)
2. defined a variables to hold the email's subject, attachments list path, recipients list, and the port number
3. defined a dictionary to hold the smtps config for gmail, and outlook, with the ability to add a new smtp
4. loading the config values from config.ini file, lines 31 - 40
5. Configurating logging to log information and errors into both: a log file and a console lines 44 - 54
6. Function main will start by getting the smtp of the sender_email define in the config.ini file, by extraction the domain from the email.
    then defined a message to be specified with subject, from email, and append the attachments to it
    after that, login to the server using the sender email and password.
    finally, for every recipient in recipients list, send email with all data in it.
7. main function is used to set up a scheduler to run work function with params taken from .env and config.ini files. the time is configured in the config.ini file.
8. Lines 98 - 101 start the main function and exit if user stopped the program
