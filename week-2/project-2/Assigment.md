# Weather APP
## App scope
The goal of this project is to create a weather app that shows the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location.
Here are the steps you can take to create this project:
   * Use the requests library to make an API call to a weather service (e.g. OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve the weather data for a specific location.
   * Use the json library to parse the JSON data returned by the API call.
   * Use the datetime library to display the current time and date.
