The Hangman game assignement is created with the following logic:
    1. in hangman packcage there are 2 classes:
        * AbstractHangman - an abstract class used to design the game logic
        * Hangman - implementation of an abstract class, defines the whole state of the game
    2. /backend/src/main.py has 3 functions:
        1. choose_a_random_word to get a random word from a big archive of words
        2. render_word_state to render the output string with lettes that are not guessed as underscors
        3. play - a function to start playing the game
    During the development process GetRandomWorld file was used to get words from an online dictionary,
    ensure that thee words are not bad words and get a definition for each of them. The definition might be used in the
    later development of the project.
