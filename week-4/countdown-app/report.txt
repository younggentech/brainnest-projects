CountDown App
This a simple countdown app that will take a number from the user
and then print a clock-like counter till the end (0)

when user enters non-numeric value, the app will raise ValueError exception
asking the user for numbers only.
when user enters number less than 0, the app will ask the user for a number >= 0

when user enter number > 0 (e.g. 100), the app will print
"the counter 100 will run for 0 hours, 1 minute, and 40 seconds"
then the clock-like counter will start ticking till 0 (on the same line)
0:1:40, then 0:1:39 ...
till 0:0:0 then the app will exit
